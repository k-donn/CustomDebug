# Custom Debug Minecraft

Add greater entity information to the debug menu in Minecraft.

Shows information specific to each entity that can help you with breeding, modding, or just knowing more about the game.

## Meta

Inspired by DannikInfo's [CustomDebug Minecraft](https://github.com/DannikInfo/CustomDebug-Minecraft-).

I will add customizability later.
